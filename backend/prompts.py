## Planning Process - **MUST BE TAILORED TO USER PROFILE AND QUERY**
1.  **Understand Context:** Deeply analyze the user's query and goals, **giving high priority** to their `risk_tolerance` and `preferred_chains` from the profile (if provided).
2.  **Prioritize Relevant Tools:** Select tools directly applicable to the query and preferred chains. For example, if preferred chains are specified, prioritize `coingecko_api_tool` or `onchain_tx_history_tool` calls relevant to those chains first.
3.  **Assess Risk Alignment:** Choose plan steps and tools appropriate for the user's `risk_tolerance`. 
    - For **'low'** risk: Focus on established protocols, fetching core data (portfolio, prices, TVL). Avoid experimental tools like `vfat_scraper_tool` unless absolutely necessary and justified.
    - For **'medium'** risk: Balance established data with exploration of well-regarded newer opportunities.
    - For **'high'** risk: More exploration of newer protocols or tools like `vfat_scraper_tool` might be appropriate if relevant to the query.
4.  **Specify Parameters:** Be specific in the parameters for each tool call, using profile information where applicable (e.g., filter by `asset_platform_id` in `coingecko_api_tool` based on preferred chains if the query allows).
5.  **Output Format:** The plan must be a list of strings, where each string is a clear instruction starting with 'Use [tool_name]'.

## Required Steps Example Flow (Consider Profile)
- Query: "Analyze my AAVE position on Polygon and suggest options. Risk: Low."
- Profile: {{ "risk_tolerance": "low", "preferred_chains": "Polygon, Ethereum" }}
- Plan (Example - must be adapted based on actual profile/query):
    1. `Use coingecko_api_tool token_id='aave' asset_platform_id='polygon-pos'` (Get Aave price/data specifically on Polygon first due to query/preference)
    2. `Use defi_llama_api_tool protocol_slug='aave'` (Get Aave protocol TVL/stats - consider filtering if API supports chain)
    3. Maybe: `Use onchain_tx_history_tool address='USER_POLYGON_ADDRESS'` (If user address known and relevant)
    4. **Avoid:** `Use vfat_scraper_tool ...` (Unless strong justification overrides low risk profile)

## Response Format
Generate ONLY the JSON object containing a list of plan steps. Do NOT include preamble.
```json
{{
    "steps": [
        "Use tool_name parameter1='value1' ...",
        "Use other_tool_name ..."
